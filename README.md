### Build tools

Use the command palette and commands listed above to build and run your Appcelerator project. Follow instructions to select platform, target and (if appropriate) code signing. The last build destination is saved for quick recall.

By default the integrated terminal is used to execute the build command.

### Autocompletion

Autocompletion support is provided to help speed up development by providing quick references to Titanium APIs and Alloy markup as well as references to modules, widgets and assets within your project.

#### Generation

On initial launch, autocomplete suggestions are generated for the current selected Titanium SDK. You can check and set this using the CLI:

```
$ appc ti sdk

...

Installed SDKs:
   7.1.0.GA [selected]  7.1.0.GA
```

```
$ appc ti sdk select
```

Autocomplete suggestions can be regenerated by running the `Generate autocomplete suggestions` command from the command palette.

#### Titanium and Alloy

Titanium APIs and Alloy markup suggestions are provided in Titanium JavaScript and Alloy XML and TSS files. This includes classes, properties, methods and events.

#### Project references

Suggestions for other controllers, modules and widgets are presented when referencing through a Titanium function or Alloy markup.

#### Class and ID references

Suggestions for classes and IDs declared or defined in related Alloy XML and TSS files are presented.

#### Images

Image suggestions are presented where appropriate.

### Open related files

Opening related Alloy files is supported (see above commands list).

* From View, open related Style and/or Controller
* From Style, open related View and/or Controller
* From Controller, open related View and/or Style

### Jump-to-definition

Jump-to-definition support is provided for quickly accessing the definiion or usage of Alloy markup and to easily generate new definitions. Images can be previewed inline.

#### Alloy

From Views, click through to style definitions for tags, classes and IDs, in related or global TSS. Click through to event definitions in the related controller.

A prompt is displayed to generate undefined styles or functions.

#### Strings

Click on localised string references to jump to their definition. The option to generate undefined strings is provided.

#### Images

Click on an image path to open a preview. For iOS, where multiple scaled images exist with the same name the first is opened (e.g. @2x).

### Snippets

Code snippets for common Alloy and Titanium APIs are provided for use in Alloy controllers and modules. A description of the snippet and link to documentation are provided where appropriate. Type the prefix and the autocomplete overlay will be displayed with matching snippets.
